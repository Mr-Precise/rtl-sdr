.LP
Much software is available for the RTL2832. Most of the user-level
packages rely on the librtlsdr library which comes as part of the
rtl-sdr codebase. This codebase contains both the library itself and
also a number of command line tools such as rtl_test, rtl_sdr,
rtl_tcp, and rtl_fm. These command line tools use the library to test
for the existence of RTL2832 devices and to perform basic data
transfer functions to and from the device.
.LP
Because most of the RTL2832 devices are connected using USB, the
librtlsdr library depends on the libusb library to communicate with
the device.
.SH USAGE
Writing bad information to the EEPROM will make your
device useless.
