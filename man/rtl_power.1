.TH rtl_power: "1" "2023.2.0" RTL_SDR "User Commands"
.SH NAME
rtl_power: \- wideband spectrum monitor utility
.SH DESCRIPTION
Uses a re-purposed DVB-T receiver as a software defined
radio to receive signals in I/Q data form. Written for
and incorporated in the osmocom rtl-sdr project.
.SH USAGE
rtl_power, a simple FFT logger for RTL2832 based DVB\-T receivers
.PP
This tool gathers signal data over a very wide area of the frequency spectrum,
and then that data can be used to find active areas of the spectrum.
.PP
Use:    rtl_power \fB\-f\fR freq_range [\-options] [filename]
.HP
\fB\-f\fR lower:upper:bin_size [Hz]
.IP
(bin size is a maximum, smaller more convenient bins
.TP
will be used.
valid range 1Hz \- 2.8MHz)
.IP
[\-i integration_interval (default: 10 seconds)]
.IP
(buggy if a full sweep takes longer than the interval)
.IP
[\-1 enables single\-shot mode (default: off)]
[\-e exit_timer (default: off/0)]
[\-d device_index (default: 0)]
[\-g tuner_gain (default: automatic)]
[\-p ppm_error (default: 0)]
filename (a '\-' dumps samples to stdout)
.IP
(omitting the filename also uses stdout)
.SS "Experimental options:"
.IP
[\-w window (default: rectangle)]
.IP
(hamming, blackman, blackman\-harris, hann\-poisson, bartlett, youssef)
.IP
[\-c crop_percent (default: 0%, recommended: 20%\-50%)]
.IP
(discards data at the edges, 100% discards everything)
(has no effect for bins larger than 1MHz)
.IP
[\-F fir_size (default: disabled)]
.IP
(enables low\-leakage downsample filter,
.TP
fir_size can be 0 or 9.
0 has bad roll off,
.IP
try with '\-c 50%')
.IP
[\-P enables peak hold (default: off)]
[\-D enable direct sampling (default: off)]
[\-O enable offset tuning (default: off)]
.SS "CSV FFT output columns:"
.IP
date, time, Hz low, Hz high, Hz step, samples, dbm, dbm, ...
.SH EXAMPLES
.IP
rtl_power \fB\-f\fR 88M:108M:125k fm_stations.csv
.IP
(creates 160 bins across the FM band,
.IP
individual stations should be visible)
.IP
rtl_power \fB\-f\fR 100M:1G:1M \fB\-i\fR 5m \fB\-1\fR survey.csv
.IP
(a five minute low res scan of nearly everything)
.IP
rtl_power \fB\-f\fR ... \fB\-i\fR 15m \fB\-1\fR log.csv
.IP
(integrate for 15 minutes and exit afterwards)
.IP
rtl_power \fB\-f\fR ... \fB\-e\fR 1h | gzip > log.csv.gz
.IP
(collect data for one hour and compress it on the fly)
