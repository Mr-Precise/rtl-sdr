.TH "rtl_test" 1 "2023.2.0" RTL-SDR "User Commands"
.SH NAME
rtl_test \- a benchmark tool for RTL2832 based DVB-T receivers
.SH DESCRIPTION
Test tuning range and functional sample rates of your device
on your system.
Uses a re-purposed DVB-T receiver as a software defined
radio. Written for and incorporated into the osmocom rtl-sdr project.
.LP
Much software is available for the RTL2832. Most of the user-level
packages rely on the librtlsdr library which comes as part of the
rtl-sdr codebase. This codebase contains both the library itself and
also a number of command line tools such as rtl_test, rtl_sdr,
rtl_tcp, and rtl_fm. These command line tools use the library to test
for the existence of RTL2832 devices and to perform basic data
transfer functions to and from the device.
.LP
Because most of the RTL2832 devices are connected using USB, the
librtlsdr library depends on the libusb library to communicate with
the device.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B  rtl_test [OPTIONS]
.SH OPTIONS
.IP "-s samplerate (default: 2048000 Hz)"
.IP "-d device_index (default: 0)"
.IP "-t enable Elonics E4000 tuner benchmark]"
.IP "-p enable PPM error measurement"
.IP "-b output_block_size (default: 16 * 16384)"
.IP "-S force sync output (default: async)"
.SH EXAMPLES
.IP "To check the possible tuning range (may heavily vary by some MHz depending on device and temperature), call"
 rtl_test -t
.IP "To check the maximum samplerate possible on your machine, type (change the rate down until no sample loss occurs):"
 rtl_test -s 3.2e6
.LP
A samplerate of 2.4e6 is known to work even over tcp connections (see
rtl_tcp above). A sample rate of 2.88e6 may work without lost samples
but this may depend on your PC/Laptop's host interface.
